# Autumn-Rose-Web-Design-Project

This collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documents work together to make an
interactive website providing information on a couple's upcoming wedding, allowing
registration fields to be completed and an animation to be shown. This is accessed
through clickable links. It also includes a handful of other clickable links which
take the user to an external website.
